              Hi there! My name is Rebecca and welcome to my learning journal.
            </h1>
            <p>
              After several months in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I
              decided to take the next step and join the Bootcamp. I wanted
              deeper feedback on my solo projects, more structured challenges,
              and the chance to connect with other people learning the same
              skills.

        <p class="section-title">How I stay committed to learning</p>

        <p>
          I’ve always enjoyed learning for learning’s sake. I used to spend
          hours watching tutorials, then immediately try to apply what I’d
          learned by building small projects or improving existing ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over time, I realized that learning stuck better when I shared it.
          Writing about what I was learning — the wins, the confusion, and the
          occasional “why isn’t this working?” moments — helped me stay
          consistent and made the process more enjoyable.
        </p>

        <p class="section-title">How I got started</p>

        <p>
          I began with a simple learning journal and slowly built it up as my
          skills grew. After each study session, I’d take notes and then write
          short summaries in my own words to make sure I actually understood the
          material.
        </p>

        <p>
          That habit made a big difference. Not only did it help concepts click
          faster, but sharing those summaries also turned out to be useful for
          others who were learning along the way.
        </p>
